# Pac-Man Controller

A simple Pac-Man controller that demonstrates how to combine state-based behavior with pathfinding to control Pac-Manâ€™s movement in the game environment. Developed as part of the course Foundations of Game Ai at the IT-University of Copenhagen

## Features
- **State-based behavior**:  
  Pac-Man switches between different states (e.g., *Chase*, *Flee*, *Wander*) depending on the game situation.
- **Pathfinding**:  
  Uses pathfinding logic to navigate the maze efficiently toward goals ( pellets, power pellets, or safe zones).
